# Assembly Reflected 

The available reflected classes are generated starting from root assemblies, generation is done using up to 10 recursions to explore for exportable Exceptions.
There are three main folders:
* [**_net462_**](net462.md) contains the reflected classes generated from .NET Framework, divided by the containing assembly
* [**_net8.0_**](net8.0.md) contains the reflected classes generated from .NET 8, divided by the containing assembly
* [**_net9.0_**](net9.0.md) contains the reflected classes generated from .NET 9, divided by the containing assembly

**JCOReflector** is the folder of common classes for both **.NET** **Framework**, **8** and **9**
